# fzf-marks
This plugin can be used to create, delete, and navigate marks in *bash* and *zsh*.
It depends on Junegunn Choi's fuzzy-finder [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).

(This video was generated with `screenkey -g $(slop -n -f '%g')` and `simplescreenrecorder`.)

# Installation

If you use *zsh*, I recommend installing with a plugin manager.
In the case of [zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen), for example,
simply add the following line to your plugin list:
```zsh
    zgen load urbainvaes/fzf-marks
```

If you use *bash*,
or if you use *zsh* without a plugin manager,
source the file `fzf-marks.plugin.bash` or `fzf-marks.plugin.zsh` from your shell startup file
to enable the plugin.

**Bash installation example**:
```bash
# Clone the git repository in the current directory
git clone https://github.com/urbainvaes/fzf-marks.git

# Add a line to ~/.bashrc to load the plugin whenever bash starts in interactive mode
echo "source $PWD/fzf-marks/fzf-marks.plugin.bash" >> ~/.bashrc

# Source the plugin now so we don't have to restart bash to start using it
source fzf-marks/fzf-marks.plugin.bash
```

**Enabling completion**:

In `bash`, completion should be available automatically.
In `zsh`, completion needs to be enabled explicitly before sourcing the plugin.
This is usually done automatically by plugin managers,
but it can also be achieved manually with the following command in your `.zshrc`.
```zsh
autoload -Uz compinit && compinit
```

# Usage
The script exposes two functions:

- **mark \<mark\>**, to register a new mark to the current directory;
- **fzm [\<optional-initial-query\>]**, to jump to or delete a mark using `fzf`.

Most of the keybindings in the search window are the default fzf ones.
The only additions are

- **ctrl-y**, to jump to a match;
- **ctrl-t**, to toggle a match for deletion;
- **ctrl-d**, to delete selected matches.

By default, the plugin binds the key `ctrl-g` to `fzm`.

# FAQ

**Question**: *Is it possible to limit the fzf search to the mark label, i.e. to exclude the path from the search?*

Yes, this is possible by passing the options `-n` (for the field number to use for the search) and `-d` (for the delimiter) to `fzf`.
For example,
```
FZF_MARKS_COMMAND="fzf --height 40% --reverse -n 1 -d ' : '"
```
